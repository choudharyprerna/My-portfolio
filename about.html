<p class="para">I am a Front-end Developer with 1 years commercial experience.  I create successful websites that are fast, easy to use, and built with best practices. I work to make a better web; one that is fast, easy to use, beautiful, accessible to all, and frustration-free. Regardless of your specific business requirements, in solving these challenges, you have a great chance of finding success online.

    My main experience is in front-end development but I also have a passion for design. Given that producing a modern website requires the combination of design, server technology, and the layer that users interacts with, I believe having experience in both design and development allows for making the most optimal user experiences. I take great pride in not only being able to complete work to the high standard you expect but also go the extra mile wherever possible. I enjoy getting to know a business, its goals, and how I can best apply myself to make sure your website succeeds. For established clients, I particularly like analysing their metrics and making data-based decisions and recommendations, leading to better rates of success.

    I can quickly and efficiently join your team using continuous-integration methods and tools such as Git and Agile. </p>


    <p class="para2">I use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to produce responsive websites and web apps that provide users the best and most appropriate experience suited to their device and browser. I write standards based code that is semantic, accessible, search-engine friendly, easy to maintain, cross browser compatible, and performant.

        Building a future-proof and easy-to-maintain website is achieved by breaking down a web page into its smallest pieces, often called components, and building them in a way that exists outside the context of the design they first appear in. This allows for components that can be re-used in other areas of a website as it grows and makes the intention easier for other developers to understand and test.  All involved in a project can rely on a style guide to understand a projectâ€™s language and produce a more consistent user experience. Re-usable components make for a website that can quickly grow as does your business. I have a special interest in use of animation on the web. I particularly like working on websites that have seamless transitions and require high-level performance to maintain a smooth and appealing website.</p>
